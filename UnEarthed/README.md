Project #2: Listicle Part 2
Overview
In this project, you'll refactor the list-based web app you developed in Unit 1 to serve data from a database. You'll need to create the database schema from scratch and seed the table with the data from each list item you choose. You'll then modify the frontend of your web app, still without using a frontend framework, to display data retrieved from the database.

If you structured your Unit 1 project well, you shouldn't need to change your list items. You should only need to create your database and hook your app up to it.

ðŸŽ¯ Goals
By the end of this assignment you will be able to...

âœ…Create a PostgreSQL database and table
âœ…Display data from a PostgreSQL database in a web app
Required Features
âœ…The web app uses only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without a frontend framework.
âœ…The web app is connected to a PostgreSQL database.
âœ…The PostgreSQL database includes a table that matches the data displayed in the web app.
